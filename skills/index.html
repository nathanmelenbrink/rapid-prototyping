### Skills Checklist:

By the end of the semester we would like you to have a working familiarity with prototyping processes and common tools around the shop, including but not limited to the drill press, band saw, grinders, various hand tools, and possibly even the mill and lathe. We would also like you to have experience with two or three CAD (computer aided design) modeling to fabrication workflows, including laser cutting, waterjet cutting, and 3d printing. You should also have basic experience with measuring, marking, and layout work, an intuition for tolerance in various processes, and to understand the difference between precision and accuracy. 

Acquisition of these skills can be accomplished either through the prototyping working that you do for the class project, or through a short exercise called *making a box three ways,* in which you will produce a small box via the laser cutter, a second small box in sheet metal, and a third that is 3D printed. If you have experience in some or all of these areas, documenting that experience through prototyping for the class project may be the most efficient way to complete this requirement. If you have little or no prior experience, you may be able to complete everything through prototyping, but should also consider proactively taking on the *box three ways* assignment as a means to acquire skills that will help you to make prototypes for the class project more efficiently.

The deliverable for the skills checklist is a page on the course website showing a photo of the each of the following:

* Layout work including measuring and marking for manual fabrication
* Use of a hand drill
* Use of a drill press
* Use of a bandsaw
* Laser cutting
	* Screenshots of a CAD model
	* Photos of the laser cutting process
	* Photo of final product produced with a laser cutter
* 3D printing
	* Screenshot of a CAD model
	* Screenshot of .stl file
	* Screenshot of 3d printer toolpaths
	* Photo of a 3d printed component
* Sheetmetal workflow
	* Photo or screenshot of layout (can be CAD or by hand)
	* Photo of cutting process (can be waterjet or manual)
	* Photos of deburring and post-processing steps
	* Photo of assembled box
* Screenshot of CAD assembly modeled that includes parts you've modeled mated with external geometry such as hardware from McMaster-Carr
