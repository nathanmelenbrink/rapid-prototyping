### Markdown 

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to valid HTML.

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

Markdown is often used in _static site generator_ platforms like Jekyll or Hugo. The downside to these platforms is that you have to install their software, and then use command line tools to locally build (i.e. convert to HTML) your site before you push it to the web. 

This page is created using a library called [https://strapdownjs.com](strapdown.js). The advantage of Strapdown is that it converts MD to HTML on the fly, so we don't need to do anything in command line. All we have to do is wrap the Markdown text in `<xmp>` tags add a reference to the library on any page we want to convert:

`<script src="https://strapdownjs.com/v/0.2/strapdown.js"> </script>`

### HTML 

The nice thing about working in Markdown is that it doesn't preclude using HTML elements directly. I can switch back and forth between MD and HTML as I write my .html file -- the end result will be 100% HTML. 

Some elements aren't handled well by Markdown, like embedding a youtube video using the [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.ASP) tag, so we can do things like that with HTML. 

HTML is not difficult to learn, but there's no reason to memorize the elements. Whenever I need to remember the syntax for an HTML element, I just look up the reference on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) (there are plenty of similar resources as well). 


### Bootstrap 

Bootstrap is (apparently) the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites. Notably, Bootstrap relies on a 12-column grid system for organizing page layouts in a way that looks good on screens of all sizes. 

Bootstrap is not necessary for every site. A page like this one is intended to be used for taking notes -- a single column is fine. On the other hand, sometimes you'll want an attractive and responsive grid layout, especially as a [home/landing page](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/howtodesign/) (notice how the page layout changes as you change the browser window size). It's completely reasonable to use Bootstrap for your home page, but stick to a simple single-column layout (i.e., no Bootstrap) for individual project pages. 

Learn more about Bootstrap on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_get_started.php). Note that there isn't much difference between Bootstrap 3, 4, and 5. If you're writing a page from scratch, it's best to use the most current version. If you're working with a template you found, it's best to stick with the version the template was made with. 

Strapdown is designed to work with Bootstrap layouts. This page is rendered using the "journal" theme, but I can choose from many others (see [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) for examples). All I have to do is change the theme in the `<xmp>` tag: `<xmp theme="journal" style="display:none;">`

Sometimes, we'll want to make small changes to a theme (font size, colors, margins, etc.). We can do that using CSS/SCSS (see below). 

You can easily add a Bootstrap layout to a Strapdown page. Below is a minimal example from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_get_started.php). (Note that inside of the Bootstrap structure, we need to use HTML tags instead of writing MD. This is because the Bootstrap formatting gets applied before Strapdown converts MD to HTML). 

<div class="container mt-5">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 1</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 2</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Column 3</h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...</p>
      <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
